title: Therapy looks like...
description: Cynthia Bascara is a speech and language therapist with more than 25 years of experience. Therapy will look somewhat different across the ages, but I strive to make therapy engaging and fun (almost as if we weren't doing "therapy" at all!).

        Therapy will look somewhat different across the ages, but Cynthia strives to make therapy engaging and fun (almost as if we weren't doing "therapy" at all!). Materials during a session will often include the use of toys (that Cynthia brings or your child's very own), games, websites / screen time, school work, and movement.

      <p class="panel__text">
        As needed, Cynthia will do a brief wrap up at the end of the session, with possible suggestions for homework.
