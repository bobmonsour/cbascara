      <h3 class="panel__title">What does a therapy session look like?</h3>
      <p>
        Therapy will look somewhat different across the ages, but I strive to
        make therapy engaging and fun (almost as if we weren't doing "therapy"
        at all!). A session will often include the use of toys, games, maybe
        some websites/screen time, and movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        As needed, I will do a brief wrap up at the end of the session, with
        possible suggestions for homework.
