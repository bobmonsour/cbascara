      <p class="panel__text">Language can take us on many adventures both imaginary and real. The words we use and how we say them can impact our everyday lives and experiences, how we experience people and the world and how they experience us. My goal is to enable your child to express herself / himself effectively to experience the worlds adventures.</p>
